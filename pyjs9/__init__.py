            After manipulating or otherwise modifying a numpy array (or making
            a new one), you can display it in js9 using the 'SetNumpy' method,

            An optional second argument specifies a datatype into which the
            array will be converted before being sent to js9. This is
            important in the case where the array has datatype np.uint64,
            which is not recognized by js9::

        (The directory and its contents will be deleted when the page is

        This routine can be used, for example, in laboratory settings where

        refreshed periodically. The first input argument can be one of the
        following:

        -  a two-dimensional list containing image pixels
        -  a dictionary containing a required image property and any of the
           following optional properties:

           -  dmin: data min (optional)
           -  dmax: data max (optional)

        When passing an object as input, the required image property that
        contains the image data can be a list or a list of lists containing
        data. It also can contain a base64-encoded string containing a list.
        This latter can be useful when calling JS9.RefreshImage() via HTTP.
        Ordinarily, when refreshing an image, there is no need to specify the
        optional axis, bitpix, or header properties. But note that you actually
        can change these values on the fly, and JS9 will process the new data
        correctly. Also, if you do not pass dmin or dmax, they will be
        calculated by JS9.

        Note that you can pass a complete FITS file to this routine. It will be
        passed to the underlying FITS-handler before being displayed.  Thus,
        processing time is slightly greater than if you pass the image data
        directly.

        The main difference between JS9.RefreshImage() and JS9.Load() is
        that the former updates the data into an existing image, while the
        latter adds a completely new image to the display.

        overall memory usage as successive images are loaded and discarded.
        Note, however, that closing an image only provides a hint to the
        browser, since this sort of garbage collection is not directly

        -  data: buffer containing raw data values

        This call can return raw data for subsequent use in local analysis
        tasks. The format of the returned data depends on the exact value of
        dflag. If dflag is the boolean value true, an HTML5 typed array
        is returned, which translates into a dictionary of pixels values in
        Python. While typed arrays are more efficient than ordinary JavaScript
        arrays, this is almost certainly not what you want in Python.

        If dflag is the string 'array', a Python list of pixel values is
        returned. Intuitively, this would seem to what is wanted, but ... it
        appears that base64-encoded strings are transferred more quickly
        through the JS9 helper than are binary data.

        If dflag is the string 'base64', a base64-encoded string is returned.
        Oddly, this seems to be the fastest method of transferring
        data via socket.io to an external process such as Python, and, in
        fact, is the method used by the pyjs9 numpy and fits routines.

        The file value can be a FITS file or a representation PNG file. The
        fits value will be the path of the FITS file associated with this
        image. For a presentation PNG file, the path generally will be relative
        to the JS9 install directory. For a normal FITS file, the path usually
        is an absolute path to the FITS file.

         - dimensions: 1024, 1024
         - bin: 2

        will bin the upper left 1024 x 1024 section of the image by 2 to
        produce a 512 x 512 image.  Note that 0,0 can be used to specify the
        file center.

        Table filtering allows you  to select rows from an FITS binary table
        (e.g., an X-ray event list) by checking each row against an expression
        involving the columns in the table. When a table is filtered, only
        valid rows satisfying these expressions are used to make the image.

        A filter expression consists of an arithmetic or logical operation
        involving one or more column values from a table. Columns can be
        compared to other columns or to numeric constants. Standard JavaScript
        math functions can be applied to columns. JavaScript (or C) semantics
        are used when constructing expressions, with the usual precedence and
        associativity rules holding sway:

          Operator                                Associativity
          --------                                -------------
          ()                                      left to right
          !  (bitwise not) - (unary minus)        right to left
          *  /                                    left to right
          +  -                                    left to right
          < <= > >=                               left to right
          == !=                                   left to right
          &  (bitwise and)                        left to right
          ^  (bitwise exclusive or)               left to right
          |  (bitwise inclusive or)               left to right
          && (logical and)                        left to right
          || (logical or)                         left to right
          =                                       right to left

        For example, if energy and pha are columns in a table, then the
        following are valid expressions:

          pha > 1
          energy == pha
          pha > 1 && energy <= 2
          max(pha,energy) >= 2.5

        NB: JS9 uses cfitsio by default (you can, but should not, use the
        deprecated fitsy.js), and therefore follows cfitsio filtering
        conventions, which are documented in:

        This routine allows you to display a 2D slice of a 3D or 4D
        FITS data cube, i.e.  a FITS image containing 3 or 4 axes.

        The slice parameter can either be the numeric value of the
        slice in the third (or fourth) image dimension (starting
        with 1) or it can be a slice description string: a combination
        of asterisks and a numeric value defines the slice axis. Thus, for
        example, in a 1024 x 1024 x 16 cube, you can display the sixth slice
        along the third axis in one of two ways:

          >>> JS9.DisplaySlice(6)

        or:

          >>> JS9.DisplaySlice("*,*,6")

        If the image was organized as 16 x 1024 x 1024, you would use the
        string description:

          >>> JS9.DisplaySlice("6,*,*")

        By default, the new slice replaces the data in the currently displayed
        image. You can display the slice as a separate image by supplying
        an opts object with its separate property set to true.
        For example:

          >>> JS9.DisplaySlice("6,*,*", {separate: true})

        will display the sixth slice of the first image dimension separately
        from the original file, allowing blinking, image blending, etc. between
        the two "files".  Note that the new id and filename are adjusted to be
        the original file's values with the cfitsio image section [6:6,*,*]

        where:

        - mode: one of the W3C bend modes
        - opacity: the opacity of the blended image (percent from 0 to 1)

        Image processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Gimp allow you
        to blend a stack of images together by mixing the RGB colors. The W3C
        has defined a number of composite and blending modes which have been
        implemented by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari (what about IE?):

        - normal
        - multiply
        - screen
        - overlay
        - darken
        - lighten

        - exclusion
        - hue
        - saturation
        - color
        - luminosity

        In addition, the following Porter-Duff compositing modes are available
        (though its unclear how useful they are in JS9 image processing):

        - clear
        - copy
        - source-over
        - destination-over
        - source-in
        - destination-in

        - destination-out
        - source-atop
        - destination-atop
        - xor
        - lighter

        Blending and compositing modes are described in detail in:

        https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing

        JS9 allows you to use these modes to blend images together. If
        you load two images of the same object into JS9, you can use
        the JS9.ReprojectData() routine to align them by WCS. You then
        can blend one image into the other by specifying a blend mode
        and an optional opacity. For example, if chandra.fits and
        spitzer.fits are two aligned images of the same object, and
        chandra.fits is currently being displayed, you can blend
        spitzer into chandra using the "screen" blend and opacity 0.9
        mode this way:

              >>> JS9.BlendImage("screen", 0.9)

        After the spitzer image is blended, both images will be
        displayed as part of the chandra.fits display. However,
        changing the colormap, scale, contrast, or bias will only
        affect the current chandra image, not the blended spitzer
        part.  In this way, you can continue to manipulate the current
        image and the image blending will update automatically.

        Also note that the spitzer image is still available separately
        for display and manipulation. You can switch to displaying
        spitzer and change colormap, scale, bias, contrast, etc. But
        since the images are now blended, changes to spitzer will be
        reflected in the spitzer part of the blended chandra
        display. Thus, if you change the colormap on the display of
        spitzer, and change back to chandra, the blended chandra image
        will utilize the new colormap.

        This linkage is maintained during zoom and pan operations. If
        you display the blended chandra image and then zoom or pan it,
        both images will be updated correctly to maintain
        alignment. But note that this means when you go back to the
        spitzer display, its zoom and/or pan values will have been
        updated. In this way, the spitzer image always is correctly
        linked to the blended version.

        The JS9.BlendImage() call accepts a variable number of
        arguments to perform a variety of functions:
        JS9.BlendImage() returns an object containing the following properties:

        - active: boolean specifying whether this image is to be blended
        - mode: string specifying the blend mode
        - opacity: opacity value (0 to 1)

          >>> JS9.BlendImage()   # returns a blend object for the current image

        - ops: array of operations on which to sync
        - images: array of images to sync with this image
        - opts: options for sync'ing

        Synchronize two or more images, so that when an operation is performed
        on one image, it also is performed on the other(s). For example, when
        the colormap or scale is changed on an image, it also is changed on
        the sync'ed images. Or, when a region is created, moved, resized, or
        removed on an image, the same happens on the sync'ed images.

        When the SyncImages() call is invoked, the current image is
        configured to synchronize the specified images.  In addition, if
        the reciprocate property is set in the opts object (see below),
        the other images are also configured to synchronize one another (as
        well as the current image). Once configuration is complete, a sync
        command is executed immediately. If the current image already
        displays one or more regions, these will be created in the target
        images.

        The operations that can be specified for sync'ing are:
        "colormap", "pan", "regions", "scale", "wcs", "zoom", "contrastbias".
        If no array is specified, the default array in JS9.globalOpts.syncOps
        is used.

        Images to synchronize can be specified as an array of image handles or
        image ids. If no array is specified, all currently displayed images
        are sync'ed.

        The optional opts object can contain:

        - reciprocate: boolean determining whether images sync one another
        - reverse: boolean to reverse this image and target images (def: false)

        If the opts object is not specified, the default value of
        reciprocate is the value of the JS9.globalOpts.syncReciprocate
        property.

        Examples:

        >>> # the current image will sync all operations for all images
        >>> # sync reciprocally, so that changing any image syncs the others
        >>> SyncImages()

        >>> # current image will sync specified ops for foo1.fits,foo2.fits:
        >>> SyncImages(["scale", "colormap"], ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"])

        >>> # the current image will sync two images with default ops,
        >>> # but the two images themselves will not sync images reciprocally
        >>> SyncImages(null, ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"], {reciprocate: false});

        Note that if the pan operation syncs two images having differently
        sized fields of view, the smaller image will stop panning when it
        reaches its edge, rather than displaying a blank field.

        You can turn on/off syncing for a given image by specifying a single
        boolean argument:

        >>> # turn off sync'ing temporarily
        >>> SyncImages(false);

        This is different from unsync'ing in that you can turn sync'ing back
        on without having to re-sync the images.

        If no array is specified, the default array in JS9.globalOpts.syncOps is

        Images to be unsync'ed can be specified as an array of image handles or

        - value: mask value that triggers masking (def: 0) for "mask" mode
        - invert: whether to invert the mask (def: false) for "mask" mode
        - def: object containing default RGBA values for "overlay" mode
        - opacity: opacity when masking (def: 0, range 0 to 1) for both mode

        The pixel values in one image can be used to mask the pixels in
        another image if the two images have the same image dimensions.
        The type of masking depends on the mode: "overlay" (default) or "mask".

        For "mask" mode, if the value of a pixel in the mask is less than or
        equal to the value property, the opacity of the displayed pixel
        is set to the opacity property. You can also invert the mask
        using the invert property. In effect, this mode displays only
        the image pixels "covered" by a mask.

        For "opacity" mode, each image pixel is assigned an opacity equal
        to the value of the mask pixel (whose values are assumed to range
        from 0 to 1.)

        For "overlay" mode, if the mask pixel has a non-zero alpha, its color
        is blended with the image pixel using source-atop composition.
        Otherwise, the image pixel color alone is used in the display.
        This is one way you can display a mask overlay on top of an image.
        A static colormap is usually used in conjunction with an overlay
        mask, since pixel values not explicitly assigned a color are
        transparent.  Note that, when blending a mask and image pixel, the
        global mask opacity and the individual pixel opacity are multiplied to
        get the final pixel opacity.

        To set up a mask initially, call the routine with an already-loaded
        mask image as the first parameter, and an optional opts object as the
        second parameter:

        >>> JS9.ImageMask("mask.fits",{"mode":"mask","value":5,"opacity":0.2});

        You can change the mask parameters at any time:

        >>> JS9.ImageMask({value: 2, opacity: 0});

        or temporarily turn off and on the mask:

        >>> JS9.ImageMask(false);

        arguments. It also takes the following single arguments:

        - invert: toggle inversion of the colormap
        - reset: reset contrast, bias, and invert values
        - staticOpts: opts for a static colormap

        The staticOpts argument is an array of parameters to change
        in a static colormap. Each parameter can take one of two forms:

        - [color, min, max]
        - [color, opacity|alpha]
        - [color, true|false]

        The color parameter must match one of the colors specified when
        the static colormap was created. The min and max properties replace
        the originally specified min and max values. Specifying a number
        between 0 and 1 (inclusive) will change the opacity, while specifying
        a number greater than 1 will change the alpha (i.e., opacity * 255).
        Specifying true or false will set or unset the active flag for that
        color, i.e.  it will turn on or off use of that color. When turned off,
        the pixels in that range will be transparent. For example:

        Add a colormap to JS9

        JS9.AddColormap(name, aa|rr,gg,bb|obj|json)

        where:

        - name: colormap name
        - aa: an array containing RGB color triplets
        - rr,gg,bb: 3 arrays of vertices specifying color changes
        - obj: object containing one of the two colormap definition formats
        - json: json string containing one of the colormap definition formats

        You can add new colormaps to JS9 using one of two formats. The
        first is an array of RGB triplets (i.e. an array of 3-D
        arrays), where each triplet defines a color. The elements of
        the colormap are divided evenly between these 3-D triplets.
        For example, the i8 colormap is defined as:

          >>> JS9.AddColormap("i8",
                              [[0,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0],
                              [1,1,0], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]))

        Here, the colormap is divided into 8 sections having the
        following colors: black, green, blue, cyan (green + blue),
        red, yellow (red + green), purple (red + blue), and white. A
        colormap such as sls also utilizes an array of RGB triplets,
        but it has 200 entries, leading to much more gradual
        transitions between colors.

        The second colormap format consists three arrays of vertices
        defining the change in intensity of red, green, and blue,
        respectively. For each of these three color triplets, the
        first coordinate of each vertex is the x-distance along the
        colormap axis (scaled from 0 to 1) and the second coordinate
        is the y-intensity of the color.  Colors are interpolated
        between the vertices.  For example, consider the following:

          >>> JS9.AddColormap("red",
                              [[0,0],[1,1]], [[0,0], [0,0]], [[0,0],[0,0]])
          >>> JS9.AddColormap("blue",
                              [[0,0],[0,0]], [[0,0], [0,0]], [[0,0],[1,1]])
          >>> JS9.AddColormap("purple",
                              [[0,0],[1,1]], [[0,0], [0,0]],[[0,0],[1,1]])

        In the red (blue) colormap, the red (blue) array contains two
        vertices, whose color ranges from no intensity (0) to full
        intensity (1) over the whole range of the colormap (0 to
        1). The same holds true for the purple colormap, except that
        both red and blue change from zero to full intensity.

        For a more complicated example, consider the a colormap, which is
        defined as:

          >>> JS9.AddColormap("a",
                              [[0,0], [0.25,0], [0.5,1], [1,1]],
                              [[0,0], [0.25,1], [0.5,0], [0.77,0], [1,1]],
                              [[0,0], [0.125,0], [0.5, 1], [0.64,0.5],
                               [0.77, 0], [1,0]])

        Here we see that red is absent for the first quarter of the
        colormap, then gradually increases to full intensity by the
        half mark, after which it stays at full intensity to the
        end. Green ramps up to full intensity in the first quarter,
        then drops to zero by the half and stays that way until a bit
        more than three-quarters along, after which it gradually
        increases again. Blue starts off at no intensity for an
        eighth, then gradually increases to full intensity by the
        half-way mark, decreasing gradually to zero by the
        three-quarter mark. The result is that you see, for example,
        green at the beginning and yellow (red + green) at the end,
        with some purple (red + blue) in the middle of the colormap.

        As a convenience, you also can pass an object or json string
        containing the colormap definition:

        # RGB color triplets for the I8 colormap in a "colors" property
        {"name":"i8",
          "colors":[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],
                    [1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]}

        # all 3 vertex arrays for purple colormap in one "vertices" property
        {"name":"purple",
         "vertices":[[[0,0],[1,1]],[[0,0],[0,0]],[[0,0],[1,1]]]}

        pixel value taken from the appropriate image. Note that all three
        images are not required: you can display an RGB image using two of
        the three colors simply by not assigning the third colormap.

        The SetRGBMode() call turns on or off RGB mode. The
        boolean mode argument specifies whether to activate or

        The floor value & opacity option allows you to set the opacity
        for pixels whose image value is less then or equal to a specified
        floor value. It takes two arguments: the floor pixel value to check,
        and the floor opacity to apply. For example, when both arguments are 0,
        pixels whose image values are less than or equal to 0
        will be transparent. Specifying 5 and 0.5, respectively, means that
        pixels whose image values less than or equal to 5 will have an opacity
        of 0.5. A useful case is to make the pixels transparent at a
        given value, allowing features of one image to be blended into
        another, without blending extraneous pixels.

        A coordinate grid displays lines of constant RA and constant Dec, with
        the points of intersection labeled by their RA and Dec values. The
        labels are in sexagesimal notation if the WCS units are sexagesimal,
        otherwise they are in degrees. When using sexagesimal notation, labels
        will be shortened if possible, e.g., if the RA hours are the same in
        two successive labels but the minutes are different, only the minutes
        are shown in the second label.

        If no arguments are supplied, the routine returns true if the
        coordinate grid is currently being displayed, false otherwise. A
        boolean first argument specifies whether to display the coordinate
        grid or not.

        The optional second argument is an opts object (or a json-formatted
        string) containing properties to override the default JS9.Grid.opts
        properties. These properties include:

        - raLines: approx. number of RA grid lines
        - decLines: approx. number of Dec grid lines
        - stride: fineness of grid lines
        - margin: edge margin for displaying a line
        - lineColor: color of grid lines
        - strokeWidth: grid stroke width
        - raAngle: rotation for RA label
        - decAngle: rotation for Dec label
        - labelColor: color of text labels
        - labelFontFamily: label font
        - labelFontSize: label font size
        - labelRAOffx: x offset of RA labels
        - labelRAOffy: y offset of RA labels
        - labelDecOffx: x offset of Dec labels
        - labelDecOffy: y offset of Dec labels
        - degPrec: precision for degree labels
        - sexaPrec: precision for sexagesimal labels
        - reduceDims: reduce lines of smaller image dim?
        - cover: grid lines cover: display or image

        The strokeWidth property determines the width of the grid
        lines. It also serves as a reminder that you can pass other
        standard shape properties in the opts object.

        JS9's label placement algorithm puts labels close to the
        intersection of RA and Dec lines. A number of properties can be
        useful in cases where this simple algorithm is not sufficient:
        the raAngle and decAngle properties allow you to rotate the
        labels with respect to the grid lines. The four
        label[RA,Dec]Off[x,y] properties allow you to move the label with
        respect to the grid lines.  The raSkip and decSkip properties
        allow you to skip labelling the first available lines within the
        display. It can be useful, for example, on a rotated image, when
        the labels are placed in a corner.

        The degPrec and sexaPrec properties specify the precision for
        degree values and segagesimal values, respectively. Higher
        precision will use more digits and take more space along each line.

        A number of properties are (more or less) internal but might be
        of use: the reduceDims property will reduce the raLines and
        decLines properties by the ratio of image dimensions if one
        dimension is smaller than the other. This can prevent crowding in
        the smaller dimension.  The stride property specifies the length
        of each line segment that together make up a grid line. A smaller
        stride might make the grid lines smoother in some cases, at the
        price of more processing time.  The cover property determines
        whether the grid is drawn over the entire image or just the
        displayed part of the image. At the moment, drawing lines over
        the displayed part of the image seems to be sufficient.

        Note that you can specify global site-wide values for all these
        parameters (overriding the JS9.Grid.opts defaults) by supplying them
        in a grid object within the globalOpts object in the js9prefs.js file.

        Example: display a coordinate grid, specifying the line color:

        - bregion: background region ("$bregions" for displayed bkgd regions)
        - opts:  optional object or json string containing region parameters

        The regcnts program (and its predecessor, funcnts) counts photons in
        specified source regions and optionally, in specified background
        regions. Displayed results include the bkgd-subtracted counts in each
        region, as well as the error on the counts, the area in each region,
        and the surface brightness (cnts/area**2) calculated for each region.
        Regcnts for desktop use is available on GitHub at:
        https://github.com/ericmandel/regions.

        The regcnts program has been compiled into JS9 using Emscripten.
        Using this routine, regcnts can be run on the FITS memory-based file
        for the currently displayed image.  The first two arguments specify
        the source region(s) and background region(s), respectively.
        You can pass a standard region specifier as the source
        or background region. If the string "$sregions" ("$bregions") is
        specified, the source (background) regions are taken from the
        currently displayed image.

        In keeping with how desktop regcnts works, if no argument or null or a
        null string is specified as the source region, the entire field is
        used as the source region. If no argument or null or a null string is
        explicitly specified as a background region, no regions are used for
        the background.  In particular, if you pass only the source region
        argument, or pass only the source region and opts arguments, no
        background region is used. To recap:

          >>> # use entire field, no background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions([opts])
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||""[, opts])

          >>> # use displayed source and displayed background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions", "$bregions"[, opts])

          >>> # use displayed source, no background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions"[, opts])

          >>> # use displayed source and specified background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions", bregions[, opts])

          >>> # use specified source, no background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions[, opts])

          >>> # use specified source and specified background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions, bregions[, opts])

          >>> # use specified source and displayed background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions, "$bregions"[, opts])

          >>> # use entire field and specified background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||"", bregions[, opts])

          >>> # use entire field and displayed background
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||"", "$bregions"[, opts])

        The third argument allows you to specify options to regcnts:

        - cmdswitches: command line switches passed to regcnts
        - dim: size of reduced image (def: max of JS9.globalOpts.image.[xy]dim)
        - reduce: reduce image size? (def: true)
        - lightwin: if true, results displayed in light window

        The command line switches that can be specified in cmdswitches are
        detailed in https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html, the regcnts help
        page.  Aside from switches which control important aspects of the
        analysis, the "-j" switch (which returns the output in JSON format)
        might be useful in the browser environment. Some examples:

          >>> # display results in a light window
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions({lightwin: true})

          >>> # return json using maximum precision in output
          >>> JS9.CountsInRegions({cmdswitches: "-j -G"})

        Results are also returned as a text string.

        The regcnts code is memory (and cpu) intensive. In the desktop
        environment, this is not typically a problem, but the
        memory-constrained browser environment can present a challenge for
        large images and binary tables.  To avoid running out of memory (and
        for large images, to speed up processing considerably), the
        CountsInRegions() routine will bin the image to reduce its size,
        unless the reduce option is explicitly set to false. The binned
        image size can be specified by the dim option, defaulting to
        the global value of the image dimension options. When a file is binned
        in this manner, the returned resolution value (e.g., arcsec/pixel)
        will reflect the applied binning. Note that the number of photons
        found inside a binned and unbinned region differ slightly, due to the
        difference in the pixel boundaries in the two cases.

        The Counts in Regions option of the Analysis -> Client-side
        Analysis menu runs regcnts on the source and background regions of
        the currently displayed image. The results are displayed in a light
        window.

        Finally, note that the main JS9 web site at https://js9.si.edu
        also offers regcnts as a server-based analysis program in the
        Analysis menu. The displayed source and background regions are passed
        to the server for processing. Because this version runs the desktop
        program, it runs on the original file and does no binning to reduce
        the image size (which, by the way, could lengthen the processing
        time). But the server-side task also can be useful for
        JS9 large file support, which involves displaying a small
        representation file associated with a much larger parent
        file stored on the server. In this case, you often want to run
        the analysis on the larger (original) file.

        The JS9.ImarithData() routine performs basic arithmetic
        (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, minimum,
        maximum, average) between the currently displayed image and
        either another image or a constant value. The first op
        argument is a string, as detailed above. The second arg1
        argument can be a numeric value or an image id. In the former
        case, the constant value is applied to each pixel in the
        image. In the latter case, the operation is performed between
        the corresponding pixels in the two images. For example:

          >>> JS9.ImarithData("max", "foo.fits")

        will make a new data layer of the currently displayed image, where
        each pixel is the larger value from that image and the foo.fits image
        (which can be in any display).

        This routine creates a new raw data layer called "imarith"
        containing the results of the operation. Successive calls to
        this routine are cumulative, so that you can build up a more
        complex operation from simple ones. For example:

          >>> # foo.fits is displayed in the "myJS9" display
          >>> myim = JS9.GetImage()
          >>> JS9.ImarithData("max", myim)
          >>> JS9.ImarithData("add", 2.718)

        will make a new data layer where each pixel is the larger value from
        the two images, after which an approximation of the irrational number
        e is added to each pixel.

        The special reset operation deletes the "imarith" raw data
        layer, allowing you to start afresh.

        The bitpix value of the new "imarith" layer is chosen as follows:

        - for operations between two images, bitpix the "larger" of
        the two images (where float is "larger" than int).

        -  for operations between an image and a constant, bitpix of -32
        (single float) is chosen unless the image itself has bitpix of -64, in
        which case the double float bitpix is chosen.

        You can override the choice of bitpix by passing a bitpix property
        in the optional opts object.

        Finally, note that the two images must have the same dimensions. We
        might be able to remove this restriction in the future, although
        it is unclear how one lines up images of different dimensions.

        In JS9, you can change the raw data (and hence the displayed
        image) using routines such as JS9.GaussBlurData() or the more
        general JS9.RawDataLayer(). You also can apply image
        processing techniques directly to the displayed RGB image
        without changing the underlying raw data, using this
        routine. The web has an overwhelming amount of information
        about image processing.  A good technical article concerning
        the use of image filters with Javascript and the HTML5 canvas
        is available at:
        http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/

        The JS9.FilterRGBImage() routine supports a number of image
        processing routines, which are listed below.  To call one of
        them using JS9.FilterRGBImage(), supply the filter name,
        followed by any filter-specific arguments, e.g.:

          >>> JS9.FilterRGBImage("luminance")
          >>> JS9.FilterRGBImage("duotone", "g")
          >>> JS9.FilterRGBImage("convolve", [-1,-1,-1,-1,8,-1,-1,-1,-1])

        You can, of course, use the default arguments where applicable.

        Note that the standard JS9 colormaps, scale, contrast and bias
        selections are applied to the raw data to regenerate the RGB
        image. Thus, if you use any of the image processing techniques
        listed below and then change colormap, contrast, bias, or
        scale, you will undo the applied image processing. This is a
        good way to reset the displayed image. The same thing can be
        accomplished programmatically by specifying "reset" as the
        filter name:

          >>> JS9.FilterRGBImage("reset")

        The following simple image processing filters are available:
        - luminance():convert to greyscale using the CIE luminance:
        0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b

        - greyscale():convert to greyscale using the standard greyscale:
        0.3*r + 0.59*g + 0.11*b

        - greyscaleAvg():convert to greyscale using averaging:
        (r+g+b) / 3

        - brighten(val): add const val to each pixel to change the brightness:
        [r + val, g + val, b + val]

        - noise(v1, v2): add random noise:
        pixel += Math.floor((Math.random()*(v2-v1)) - v2),
        defaults are v1=-30, v2=30

        - duotone("r"|"g"|"b"): remove a color by setting it to
        the avg of the two others: r=(g+b)/2, default color is "r"

        - invert(): the RGB channels of the image are inverted:
        [255-r, 255-g, 255-b, a]

        - pixelate(size):make image look coarser by creating a square tiling
        effect of the specified size, default size is 2

        - sepia(): image takes on shades of brown, like an antique photograph

        - contrast(val): change the difference in brightness between the min
        and max intensity of a pixel, default val is 2

        - threshold(thresh, low, high):create a two-color image in which pixels
        less bright than thresh are assigned the low value (default 0 for
        black), otherwise the high value (default: 255 for white)

        - gamma(gcorr): apply the nonlinear gamma operation, used to code and
        decode luminance values in video or still image systems:
        out = pow(in, gcorr), default gcorr is 0.2

        - posterize(): convert a smooth gradation of tone to regions
        of fewer tones, with abrupt changes between them

        - scatter(): scatters the colors of a pixel in its neighborhood, akin
        to viewing through brittle cracked glass

        - solarize(): which image is wholly or partially reversed in
        tone. Dark areas appear light or light areas appear dark.

        The following image convolutions are available:

        - convolve(weights, [opaque]) convolve the image using the
        weights array as a square convolution matrix. If opaque is true
        (default), the image will have an opaque alpha channel, otherwise the
        alpha is convolved as well.

        - sobel(): use the Sobel operator to create an image that
              emphasizes the edges

        - medianFilter(): noise reduction technique that replaces each
              pixel with the median of neighboring pixels

        - gaussBlur5(): image pixel values are blurred using a 5x5 Gaussian

        - edgeDetect(): detect edges using the kernel
        [ -1, -1, -1, -1, 8, -1, -1, -1, -1 ]

        - sharpen(val): sharpen the image using the kernel
        [ 0, -3, 0, -3, val, -3, 0, -3, 0 ]

        - blur(): blur the image using the kernel
        [ 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 ]

        - emboss(val): produce embossing effect using the kernel
        [-18, -9, 9, -9, 100 - val, 9, 0, 9, 18 ]

        - lighten(val): apply the kernel
        [ 0, 0, 0, 0, val, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
        default val of 12/9 lightens the image

        - darken(val): apply the kernel
        [ 0, 0, 0, 0, val, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        default val of 6/9 darkens the image

        JS9.ReprojectData() creates a new raw data layer (with default id of
        "reproject") in which the pixels are reprojected using the WCS from
        another image. The mProjectPP program from the Montage software suite
        is used to perform the reprojection.  Please read the documentation on
        mProjectPP from the Montage web site, which includes this explanation:

        mProjectPP performs a plane-to-plane transform on the input
        image, and is an adaptation of the Mopex algorithm and
        developed in collaboration with the Spitzer Space
        Telescope. It provides a speed increase of approximately a
        factor of 30 over the general-purpose mProject. However,
        mProjectPP is only suitable for projections which can be
        approximated by tangent-plane projections (TAN, SIN, ZEA, STG,
        ARC), and is therefore not suited for images covering large
        portions of the sky. Also note that it does not directly
        support changes in coordinate system (i.e. equatorial to
        galactic coordinates), though these changes can be facilitated
        by the use of an alternate header.

        The wcsim argument is an image id, image filename, or image
        object pointing to the WCS image.

        The opts object can contain the following reproject-specific props:

        - rawid: the id of the raw data layer to create (default: "reproject")
        - cmdswitches: a string containing mProjectPP command line switches

        The cmdswitches will be prepended to the mProjectPP command line:

        {cmdswitches: "-d 1 -z .75"}

        will set the mProjectPP debugging and the drizzle factor,
        resulting in a command line that looks like this:

        mProjectPP -d 1 -z .75 -s statusfile in.fits out.fits template.hdr

        See the mProjectPP documentation for more information about
        command switches.

        Reprojection is an intensive process which can take a
        considerable amount of memory and processing time. To avoid
        crashes, we currently restrict the WCS image size used for
        reprojection to a value defined by JS9.REPROJDIM, currently
        2200 x 2200. Even this might be too large for iOS devices
        under certain circumstances, although issues regarding memory
        are evolving rapidly.

        gathered into a group selection by pressing the left mouse button and
        dragging the mouse over the desired shapes. To add to an
        already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a shape.

        This routine allows you to create a selection programmatically by
        specifying which shapes make up the selection. The first argument
        is the shape layer. The second argument is the regions selection.
        If not specified, it defaults to "all". The call creates a selection

        Regions in a selection are processed individually, i.e. a regions

        the "circle" specification will also affect the circles within the

        -  groupid: the group id associated with the newly created group

        A shape group can be moved and resized as a single unit. To
        first order, it is a long-lived form of a region selection.
        The latter gets dissolved when you click the mouse outside the
        selection, but a shape group is dissolved only by
        calling j.UngroupShapes().

        This routine allows you to create a group by specifying the shapes
        which will compose it.  The first argument is the regions selection.
        If not specified, it defaults to either 'selected' or 'all', depending
        on whether a shape selection currently exits.

        The optional opts argument contains the following properties:

        -  groupid: the group id to use, if possible (default: 'group_[n]')
        -  select: if false, the group is not selected upon creation

        By default, the groupid will be the string 'group_' followed by
        an integer chosen so that the groupid is unique. You can supply your
        own groupid, but if it already is associated with an existing group,
        an integer value will be appended to make it unique. Also, by default
        the newly created group will be 'selected'.  You can pass
        the select property with a value of false in order to
        avoid selecting the group (e.g., if you are creating a number of
        groups and do not want to see each of them selected in turn.)

        The returned groupid string can be used to select and process all the
        shapes in that group. Thus, for example, you can use the groupid to
        change the color of all grouped shapes:

        >>> gid = j.GroupShapes('myreg', 'circle && foo1');
        >>> j.ChangeShapes('myreg', gid, {'color':'red'});

        Note however, that unlike the temporary shape selections, shapes
        in a group are not available individually, i.e., a regions selection
        using a non-groupid does not match shapes inside a group. Thus, for
        example, if you have created a group of circles, changing the color
        using a 'circle' specification does not affect circles within the group:

        >>> gid = j.GroupShapes('myreg', 'circle && foo1');
        >>> j.ChangeShapes('myreg', 'circle', {'color':'cyan'}) # no
        >>> j.ChangeShapes('myreg', gid, {'color':'red'});      # yes

        Furthermore, a given shape can only be part of one group at a
        time. In the case where a shape already is part of an existing group,
        the globalOpts.regGroupConflict property determines how that shape
        is processed.  The default is skip, meaning that the shape is
        silently skipped over when creating the new group. The alternative
        is error, which will throw an error.

        JS9 has a rich mouse-based interface for selecting regions: a single
        region is selected by clicking on it. A number of regions can be
        gathered into a group selection by pressing the left mouse button and
        dragging the mouse over the desired regions. To add to an
        already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a region.

        This routine allows you to create a selection programmatically by
        specifying which regions make up the selection.  The first argument is
        the regions selection.  If not specified, it defaults to "all".

        For example:

        Regions in a selection are processed individually, i.e. a regions
        selection will match the regions inside a group. Thus for example,
        if you create a selection containing circles, changing the color using
        the "circle" specification will also affect the circles within the

        returns:

        -  groupid: the group id associated with the newly created group

        A region group can be moved and resized as a single unit. To
        first order, it is a long-lived form of a region selection.
        The latter gets dissolved when you click the mouse outside the
        selection, but a region group is dissolved only by calling
        JS9.UngroupRegions().

        This routine allows you to create a group by specifying the regions
        which will compose it.  The first argument is the regions selection.
        If not specified, it defaults to either 'selected' or 'all', depending
        on whether a region selection currently exits.

        The optional opts argument contains the following properties:

        -  groupid: the group id to use, if possible (default: 'group_[n]')
        -  select: if false, the group is not selected upon creation

        By default, the groupid will be the string 'group_' followed by
        an integer chosen so that the groupid is unique. You can supply your
        own groupid, but if it already is associated with an existing group,
        an integer value will be appended to make it unique. Also, by default
        the newly created group will be 'selected'.  You can pass
        the select property with a value of false in order to
        avoid selecting the group (e.g., if you are creating a number of
        groups and do not want to see each of them selected in turn.)

        The returned groupid string can be used to select and process all the
        regions in that group. Thus, for example, you can use the groupid to
        change the color of all grouped regions:

        >>> gid = j.GroupRegions('circle && foo1');
        >>> j.ChangeRegions(gid, {'color':'red'});

        Furthermore, when creating a regions file via JS9.SaveRegions(),
        the groupid will be stored in each grouped region's JSON object, and
        will be used to reconstitute the group when the file is reloaded.

        Note however, that unlike the temporary region selections, regions
        in a group are not available individually, i.e., a regions selection
        using a non-groupid does not match regions inside a group. Thus, for
        example, if you have created a group of circles, changing the color
        using a 'circle' specification does not affect circles within the group:

        >>> gid = j.GroupRegions('circle && foo1');
        >>> j.ChangeRegions('circle', {'color':'cyan'}) # won't change group
        >>> j.ChangeRegions(gid, {'color':'red'}); # change regions in group

        Furthermore, a given region can only be part of one group at a
        time. In the case where a region already is part of an existing group,
        the globalOpts.regGroupConflict property determines how that region
        is processed.  The default is skip, meaning that the region is
        silently skipped over when creating the new group. The alternative
        is error, which will throw an error.

        hovers over a tool.

        - [object]: an object is assumed to be new tool to add to the toolbar
        - [array]: an array is assumed to be an array of new tools to add to

        New tools can be added to the toolbar at any time using this routine.

        - cmd: name of the JS9 public routine to execute when the tool is

        - which: which images to use in the mosaic
        - opts: mosaic options

        The JS9.CreateMosaic() creates a mosaic image from the specified
        (previously-loaded) FITS images using the mProjectPP and mAdd programs
        form the Montage software suite. These Montage programs have been
        compiled into JS9 using Emscripten.

        Because the browser environment is memory-limited, there are some
        restrictions on generating mosaics in JS9. The FITS files must be
        well-behaved, i.e. they must have WCS projections which can be
        approximated by tangent-plane projections (TAN, SIN, ZEA, STG, ARC).
        This precludes creating mosaics from images covering large portions of
        the sky. For large sky areas, please use Montage itself on your desktop
        to create a mosaic. A simplified js9mosaic script is included in
        the JS9 distribution or, for more control, use the Montage programs
        directly. Of course, in either case, you must install Montage.

        The which parameter determine which images are used in the mosaic:

        - "current" or null: the current image in this display
        - "all": all images in this display
        - im: the image id an image from any display
        - [im1, im2, ...]: an array of image ids from any display

        Use "current" (or null) if you have loaded a multi-extension
        FITS mosaic into JS9. Use "all" if you have loaded several
        FITS files into JS9 and want to create a mosaic.

        In order to keep the size of the resulting mosaic within memory
        limits, JS9 reduces the size of each image before adding them all
        together The options parameter determines how the reduction is
        performed:

        - dim: size of mosaic (def: max of JS9.globalOpts.image.[xdim,ydim])
        - reduce: image size reduction technique: "js9" (def) or "shrink"
        - verbose: if true, processing output is sent to the javascript console

        The "dim" parameter is a target size: the larger of the resulting
        mosaic dimensions will be approximately this value, depending on how
        Montage processes the images. The "reduce" technique either runs
        internal JS9 image sectioning code (to produce smaller internal
        images, each of which are reprojected and added together) or runs the
        Montage mShrinkHdr code (which reprojects the full images into smaller
        files). The former seems to be faster than the latter in most
        cases. The "verbose" parameter will display output on the JavaScript
        console to let you know that the CreateMosaic() call is running
        properly.

        The resulting mosaic will be loaded into the specified JS9 display as
        a separate image. Because the mosaic is separate from the original
        image(s), you can view each of the latter individually (or view each
        image extension of a single image using the Extensions plugin).
        Internal analysis can be performed on the mosaic but,
        of course, no external analysis tasks will be available.

        Display arbitrary content inside a light window. There are any number
        of light window routines available on the Net. JS9 uses light window
        routines developed by Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com).
        Extensive documentation can be found on the Dynamic Drive web
        site: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex8/dhtmlwindow.

        The content shown inside the window depends on the content parameter:

        -  iframe: the URL of the page to display (ie: "http://www.google.com")
        - inline: the HTML to display (back-slashing any special JavaScript
        characters, such as apostrophes)
        - ajax: the relative path to the external page to display, relative to
        the current page (ie: "../external.htm")
        - div: define a DIV element on the page with a unique ID attribute
        (probably hidden using style="display:none") and the use the DIV's id
        as the content value

        JS9 typically uses the inline option. Note that web sites often
        do not allow themselves to be embedded in an iframe, so this is an
        unreliable option.

        The opts parameter specifies options for the light window, such
        as its size.  This parameter consists of a string with comma-separated
        keywords, e.g.:

        >>> "width=830px,height=400px,center=1,resize=1,scrolling=1"

        The opts keywords, defined in the Dynamic Drive documentation, are:
        width, height, left, top, center, resize, and scrolling.  The
        JS9.lightOpts.dhtml object defines oft-used lightwin configurations,
        and the JS9.lightOpts.dhtml.textWin property is used as the
        default for this call. You can utilize these properties in your own
        call to LightWindow() or make up your own configuration string.

        As an extension to the Dynamic Drive light window support, JS9 adds
        the ability to double-click the title bar in order to close the window.
